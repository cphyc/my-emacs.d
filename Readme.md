# Installation

Clone it to your `~/.emacs.d` directory:
```bash
cd
git clone https://github.com/cphyc/my-emacs.d.git .emacs.d
```
and that's it! Just relaunch emacs.

# Customization
If you want to customize your installation, edit the file `~/.emacs.d/init.el`, especially around lines 43-61. The specifics are defined per-langage in `~/.emacs.d/config`.
